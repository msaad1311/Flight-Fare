## Overview
The app is a Flask based web application that predicts the flight fare on the basis of the itinerary provided. The prediction is done via Machine Learning algorithm. 

## Motivation
In today depleting economy and increasing inflation rate, saving holds a paramount importance for people across the globe. Therefore, having an outlook of the future price trend for different items will aid people in altering their purchasing strategy. This app caters this aspect. It predicts the fare of the flights on the basis of the itinerary thereby, giving the expected fare to the user. This will help the user to determine whether the current actual fare is overpriced or underpriced enabling them to make a better informed decision.
